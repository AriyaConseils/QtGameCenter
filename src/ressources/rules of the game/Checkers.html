    <h1>Rules of Checkers</h1>
    <p>Checkers is a classic board game played between two players. Here are the rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The game is played on a <span class="important">8x8 board</span> with alternating light and dark squares.</li>
        <li>Each player starts with <span class="important">12 pieces</span>, placed on the dark squares of the three rows closest to them.</li>
        <li>Players take turns moving one piece diagonally forward to an adjacent empty square.</li>
        <li>If a player's piece jumps over an opponent's piece to land on an empty square, the opponent's piece is <span class="important">captured</span> and removed from the board.</li>
        <li>If a piece reaches the opponent's back row, it becomes a <span class="important">King</span> and gains the ability to move both forward and backward.</li>
        <li>The game is won when a player captures all the opponent's pieces or blocks all their possible moves.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Enjoy the game and may the best strategist win!</p>
