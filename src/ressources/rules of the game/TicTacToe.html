    <h1>Rules of Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>
    <p>Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game played between two players. Here are the rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The game is played on a <span class="important">3x3 grid</span>.</li>
        <li>One player uses the symbol <span class="important">"X"</span> and the other uses <span class="important">"O"</span>.</li>
        <li>Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty square.</li>
        <li>The goal is to place <span class="important">three of your symbols</span> in a row, column, or diagonal.</li>
        <li>The first player to achieve this goal <span class="important">wins the game</span>.</li>
        <li>If all squares are filled without any player aligning three symbols, the game is declared a <span class="important">draw</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Have fun and may the best player win!</p>
