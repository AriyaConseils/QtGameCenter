    <h1>Rules of Go</h1>
    <p>Go is an ancient strategy board game for two players. Here are the basic rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The game is played on a square board of <span class="important">19x19 lines</span>, but smaller boards (like <span class="important">9x9</span> or <span class="important">13x13</span>) are also used for beginners or quick games.</li>
        <li>Each player has an unlimited supply of pieces called <span class="important">stones</span>. One player uses black stones, and the other uses white stones.</li>
        <li>Players take turns placing one stone on the intersections of the grid lines.</li>
        <li>The goal is to <span class="important">surround more territory</span> on the board than your opponent.</li>
        <li>Stones are removed from the board when they are completely surrounded by the opponent's stones. This is called a <span class="important">capture</span>.</li>
        <li>The game ends when both players agree there are no more beneficial moves, and the score is calculated based on <span class="important">controlled territory</span> and captured stones.</li>
        <li>The player with the highest score <span class="important">wins</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Enjoy the game of Go, where every move is a step towards mastering strategy!</p>
